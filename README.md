# 21API

This api will allow you to use the Leaf iOS Dashboard for your 21 computer.

The following steps will get you up and running:

1. Change the code variable on line 27 to a value of your choosing. This will act as the password for your API. `code = "<add-authorization-code-here>"`
2. Start the application by running `python3 21api.py`
3. Open your Leaf Dashboard application, and enter your endpoint (i.e. http://123.4.55.6:3456) and authorization code. If you are not on the same network as your 21 Computer, you will need to use your external IP address and enable port forwarding.
4. If you receive any errors, you can reenter your endpoint information by tapping the settings icon in the app.

Thank you so much for volunteering to help, and please reach out to me on Slack with any questions!
